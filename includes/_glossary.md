# Glossary

Our intent is to make using the Kumoru service as simple as possible.  We try to use generic technology terms that one would already be familiar with, but we can't meet everyone's expectations or experience.  Using the following definitions will help you understand how to navigate the Kumoru experience.

- _Account_: data representing an user
- _Application_: information Kumoru will use to create a deployment.
- _Deployment_: an immutable instantiation of an application.
- _Location: clustered resources in a cloud provider managed by Kumoru
