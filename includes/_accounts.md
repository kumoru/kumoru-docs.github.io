# Account Management

Accounts are used to provide users access to the service.  The permissions structure is designed that a person only needs one Kumoru account. This account can be a member of multiple roles, even across organization.

An account is required to create a pair of tokens which are then used for all future communication.

## Create an Account

```shell
kumoru accounts create -f Roxy -l Ring roxy.ring@example.com
```

### Options
Concept | CLI option | Description
------- | ---------- | -----------
given name | -f | Your first name
surname | -l | Your last name
password | -p | Your password (OPTIONAL)

<aside class="info">The Kumoru CLI will prompt you for a password by neglecting the `-p` option.</aside>

Concept | CLI Arguement | Description
------- | ------------- | -----------
email | 1st | The email associated with the user

## Show an Account

```shell
kumoru accounts show roxy.ring@example.com
```

# Tokens

###Definition:
A set of UUIDs, one public and one private, that is used to sign all requests to the Kumoru APIs.

All HTTP requests to Kumoru.io services must be cryptographically signed. The Kumoru APIs follow the [Internet Draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-05) which describes message signing. This is very similar to how [AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html) signs their requests.

<aside class="warning">cURL isn't available to interact with the APIs due to the requirement that all requests be signed.</aside>

As of April 2016:
- You can have as many tokens as you like and tokens do not expire.
- Both UUIDs are generated by the authorization API.

In the future:

- The private token in the pair will be encrypted and not accessible by anyone but yourself. If you lose this token are suspect it is compromised, it is recommend you remove the token and use a new one.

<aside class="info">Reminder: Tokens are specific to your account and should not be shared.</aside>

## Create a Token

```shell
kumoru tokens create

Generating new token.
Enter Username: roxy.ring@example.com
Enter Password:
```

Concept | CLI Option | Description
------- | ---------- | -----------
force | --force | overwrite config file even it exists
don't save | -d | Print tokens to screen instead of writing to file

## Delete a Token
