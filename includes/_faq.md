# FAQ

### Why can't stateful applications deployed in Kumoru.io?

Technically, they can. However there is no gaurantee of state for a given container or between containers.
This means that if you were to deploy a mysql image, there would be two running containers of mysql with no
shared data between them. If there is a failure, a new container will be scheduled and will not have any data from the failed container.

These restrictions are forced because we view infrastructure as needing separate scaling mechanisms. Databases require a very different approach to scaling than an API service and should be treated as such.

We expect users to leverage remote resources for state. This means you can consume a cloud service (i.e. RDS) or run your own service (i.e. mysql on EC2). Both can be accessed by your service via Environment Variables.

### Do you dogfood your service?

I'm glad you asked. The answer is yes. We are our first customer!

The APIs you interact with when consuming kumoru.io are all hosted via Kumoru.io.

### Can you explain deployments and applications better?

Applications are simply the instructions for deployments. When an application is created, we've really just saved the rules for future deployments which is why a deployment is required to get the application running.

Deployments on the otherhand represent the running point in time of an application. As such, deployments are immutable. This has the following side effects:

1. Details about a application at a specific point in time are stored forever as a deployment and can be retrieved later to see how an application has changed.
2. Deployments can be used to rollback an application to the state when they were created.

The vast majority of actions an user will take on kumoru is deploying applications. After the initial deployment, deploying updates is a very quick process (depending on docker image size).
